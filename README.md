Revisiting [CPSC 449 group project][1] taken in Spring 2020

**What's new this time?**

  + CI / CD pipelines using Circle CI
  + Source code and test coverage integration
  + Postgres database instead of sqlite
  + No Flask blueprints, focus on clearly modulated OOP
  + Segregated unit, functional, and load testing
